# Number Guessing Game

## Introduction

This is a simple yet engaging number guessing game developed using C++. The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 100 and challenges the player to guess it. With each guess, the game provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or close to the target number, guiding the player towards the correct answer.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the `Number_Guess_Game.cpp` executable. This will initiate the game and display the welcome screen.
2. **Choose Your Option**: You will be presented with two options:
   - Enter `1` to start playing the game.
   - Enter `0` to exit the game without playing.
3. **Guess the Number**: If you choose to play, enter your guessed number when prompted. The game will then provide feedback based on your guess.
4. **Feedback and Repeating the Game**: Based on your guess, the game will give hints such as "Your guess is too high," "Your guess is too low," or "You are close to the number." You can continue guessing until you correctly guess the number or decide to exit the game.

## Exiting the Game

To exit the game during gameplay, press `Ctrl + C`. Alternatively, you can select option `0` at the beginning to not start the game.

## Building and Running the Game

To build and run the game, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. Open the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing `Number_Guess_Game.cpp`, and compile the source code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++). After compilation, execute the generated binary to start playing the game.
